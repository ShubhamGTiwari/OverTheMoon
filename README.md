# Over The Moon
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and datasets for the Microsoft's Explore space with Python and Visual Studio Code; inspired by Netflix's Over the Moon. This Project begins to explore how we can use data and a bit of Python coding to come up with an understanding of what we have, and make recommendations for what the next pair of astronauts should look for when they land on the Moon as part of the Artemis program in 2024.

## Project Description
Moon rocks are a huge part of the scientific discovery and understanding of our universe and planet. They can tell us about how planets and moons were formed and guide us as we prepare for further space exploration.

Though NASA's Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office has a list of all extraterrestrial samples from the Moon and elsewhere, this module focuses on those collected from the Moon. Across the six Apollo missions that landed humans on the Moon, and the three lunar missions that landed robotic probes on the Moon, we've successfully returned 383 kilograms (over 800 pounds) of rocks, soil, core samples. All of these samples have been categorized and photographed and are available to view on the NASA Lunar Sample and Photo Catalog.

The primary goal of this project is to focuses on the weights, types, and number of samples for each Apollo missionand and make recommendations for what the next pair of astronauts should look for when they land on the Moon as part of the Artemis program in 2024.
